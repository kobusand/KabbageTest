# Kabbage Prequalfiied API
This application retrieves user information from a simple form and passes it to the Kabbage prequalification API.  If the user is qualified then it displays the amount they are qualified for and a "sign up" button to redirect to the Kabbage sign up form.  If the user fails to meet the necessary criteria it will let them know that they are not qualified for a loan.
#Web Pitfalls
This is my first time connecting to an API.   It is also my first time connecting to something via JavaScript.  I wanted to use JS, because I believe the page just runs smoother for the customer.  I was really only doing this for my own personal knowledge since it was my first time even attempting something like this.  There are probably several pitfalls to my application, and I know validation could be done a better way.  This test did not take long to do even with the amount of googling I had to do, but the end results are close to what your instructions are looking for.
