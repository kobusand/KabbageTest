# Kabbage Prequalfiied API
This application retrieves user information from a simple form and passes it to the Kabbage prequalification API.  If the user is qualified then it displays the amount they are qualified for and a "sign up" button to redirect to the Kabbage sign up form.  If the user fails to meet the necessary criteria it will let them know that they are not qualified for a loan.
#Web Pitfalls
This is my first time connecting to an API.   It is also my first time connecting to something via JavaScript.  I chose javascript because I feel the page appears more cleaner with the majority of the work being handled on the client side.  I could have handled error checking better.  I saw that you send data back if it is in the incorrect format.  I attempted to parse through that information, but ended up just going for a simple check on the textbox inputs.
